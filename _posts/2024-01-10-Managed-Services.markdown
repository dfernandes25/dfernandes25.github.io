### Managed Services ###  

#### Prevailing Wisdom - Consulting or Managed Services? ####  
I'm often asked -- why provide managed services rather than focus only on project consulting?
The prevailing wisdom among many of my peers, (and definitely some truths to their thinking) is  
- Consulting is sexier and cooler than managed services
- Consulting is more cutting edge than managed services
- Consulting is more profitable than managed services
- Consulting allows you to be location independent
- Managed services is a high touch environment
- Managed services is a low profit margin business
- Managed services is IT low tech, the equivalent of AAA baseball vs. MLB
- Managed services is boring and repetitive

I'm not a business expert but for 17+ years CBC has offered clients both services.
We are fortunate, the business provided us the means to raise a family, put our kids through college,
and presented an opportunity to relocate without incurring significant business disruptions, (not zero...more on that later).
My breakdown on the prevailing wisdom follows, your mileage will vary and this is not career advice!

#### Consulting is sexier and cooler than Managed Services ####
No doubt, everyone wants to rep they've done work with Apple, Dell, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, etc.
Looks great on the resume, expense account, free lunches, blah, blah, blah.
As someone who has worked for, or currently provides services to all the above, here's my take.  
- Do they have cool tech and gadgets? Absolutely!  
- Super smart Harvard, MIT, CMU, Stanford grads who will change the world? Don't discourage them, I admire the youthful ambition!  
- Yearly sales conferences at exotic locales with Beyonce headlining? Depends on the numbers!

Make no mistake and have no doubt, at the end of the day    
- Working for a publicly held company requires one thing only, **make your number/kpi/quota--every quarter**  
- Consulting for a publicly held company has two requirements, **your project is on-time and at/under budget**
