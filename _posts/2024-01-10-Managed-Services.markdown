### Managed Services ###  

#### Prevailing Wisdom - Consulting or Managed Services ####  
I'm often asked -- why provide managed services rather than focus only on project consulting.
The prevailing wisdom among many of my peers, (and there are definitely some truths to their thinking) is  
- Consulting is sexier and cooler than managed services
- Consulting is more cutting edge than managed services
- Consulting is more profitable than managed services
- Consulting allows you to be location independent
- Managed services is a high touch environment
- Managed services is a low profit margin business
- Managed services is IT low tech, the equivalent of AAA baseball vs. MLB
- Managed services is boring and repetitive

I'm not a business expert but for 17+ years CBC has offered clients both consulting and managed services.
We are incredibly fortunate as the business provided us a means to raise a family, get two kids through college without student loan hangovers,
and allowed my wife and I an opportunity to relocate without significant business impact, (but not zero...more on that later).
What follows is my breakdown on the pros and cons, and your mileage may vary, this is not business advice!

#### Consulting is sexier and cooler than Managed Services ####
No doubt in my mind, everyone wants to rep they've done work with Apple, Dell, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, etc.
As someone who worked for, or provides services to all of the above, here's my take.  
Do they have cool tech and gadgets? Absolutely!  
Super smart Harvard, MIT, CMU, Stanford grads who want to change the world? Maybe!  
Yearly sales conferences at exotic locales with Beyonce headlining? Depends on the numbers!  
Make no mistake and have no doubt, at the end of the day    
- Working for a publicly held company requires one thing, and one thing only--make your number/kpi/quota--every quarter  
- Consulting for a publicly held company has two requirements, your project is on-time and at/under budget
