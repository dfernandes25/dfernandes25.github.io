History repeats itself.

Lately, I've noticed an increase in usually cautious, sober-minded, grounded people claiming expertise in AI, AGI, and various versions of 'GPT' (in their emails, blogs, LinkedIn feeds, etc.).

Maybe I'm just an old IT guy stuck in the past, but it took me many years of education, hands-on training, and real-world experience to become proficient in designing and implementing enterprise-class systems.

ChatGPT for the general public was released in November 2022, and I'm struggling to understand the sudden explosion of people claiming AI 'expertise'. It reminds me of the early 'cloudy' days when everyone seemed to suddenly acquire 'cloud' experience. Let's not jump headfirst into launching a revolutionary technology spearheaded by sales, marketing, and inexperienced IT specialists.
