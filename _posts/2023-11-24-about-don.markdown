Writing intros is hard, here's my spiel...  
  
**Mission Statement** 
I founded CBC Technologies, (aka CBC), on January 1, 2007 to provide commercial and residential clients affordable, reliable computer, printer, and network solutions.  
- Affordable does NOT mean lowest price -- if you're shopping for cheapest, (aka 'race to the bottom'), please keep moving, nothing to see here  
- Reliability is a balanced negotiation between three criteria:  
-- good
-- fast  
-- cheap  
Pick any two and CBC will deliver. The road to purgatory is littered with the bodies of arrogant project managers who thought they could deliver all three.
