Writing intros is hard, here's my spiel...  
  
**My Mission Statement**  
 
CBC Technologies, (aka CBC), was founded on January 1, 2007 to provide commercial and residential clients affordable, reliable computer, printer, and network solutions.
- Affordable does NOT mean lowest cost -- if you're shopping for cheap, (aka 'race to the bottom'), please keep moving, nothing to see here  
- Reliability is a balance of:  
-- good  
-- fast  
-- cheap  

As the old marketing slogan goes -- pick any two but you can't have all three.
