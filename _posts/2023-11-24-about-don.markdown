Writing intros is hard, here's my spiel...  
  
**My Mission Statement**  
 
CBC Technologies, (aka CBC), was founded on January 1, 2007 to provide commercial and residential clients affordable, reliable computer, printer, and network solutions.
- Affordable is NOT lowest cost -- if you're shopping for the cheapest service and support, (aka race to the bottom), please keep moving as there is nothing to see here. 
- Reliability is a balance between:  
-- good  
-- fast  
-- cost  
General rule of thumb is pick any two, trying to achieve all three is incredibly difficult.
