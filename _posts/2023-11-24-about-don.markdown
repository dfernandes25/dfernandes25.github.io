Writing intros is hard, here's my spiel...  
  
**Mission Statement** 
I founded CBC Technologies, (aka CBC), on January 1, 2007 to provide commercial and residential clients affordable, reliable computer, printer, and network solutions.
***Helpful Explainer****  
- Affordable does NOT mean lowest price -- if you're shopping for cheapest, (aka 'race to the bottom'), please keep moving, nothing to see here  
- Reliability is a balanced negotiation between three criteria: good, fast, cheap. Generally speaking, pick any two and CBC will deliver.
If requirements necessitate full inclusion of all three criteria -- CBC thanks you for the opportunity, but respectfully declines -- your project WILL fail.  

**My Background**  
I'm a former US Navy submarine nuclear reactor operator:
